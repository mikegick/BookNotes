## Philosophy of Software Design

#### Preface
1. "there has been surprisingly little conversation about how to design those programs or what good programs look like" <- I guess you have to sell your book somehow, but c'mon man
    1. Clean Code/The Clean Coder
    2. Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby (POODR)
